# WorkbenchHelper
Stardew Valley SMAPI Mod - Allows you to add to all existing stacks within all your chests around the workbench with a single click.


# Description
Adds a button to your workbench menu that works like add to existing stacks, but is connected with every chest around the workbench in the location.

# Installation
* Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
* Unzip this mod into Stardew Valley/Mods.
* Run the game using SMAPI.

# Compatibility
* Works with Stardew Valley 1.4.5 on Windows. Unknown capability for other platforms/mobile. Let me know if there are issues and I'll see what I can do.
* Works in single player. Multiplayer functionality has been added but not tested. The button should be disabled if more than one chest is in use at a time.
* Not tested for compatibility with other mods that alter the workbench UI. If conflicts exist, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

# Usage
As soon as you have chests around a workbench, there will be a new button on the UI to add to all existing stacks within all those chests. Note that if you only have one chest it will act the same as the add to existing stacks button.

# Uninstalling
Remove the mod from the Stardew Valley/Mods folder.
